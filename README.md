# Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my analytics portfolio! Here, I showcase projects that illustrate my work in people analytics, data science, and data analysis.

## Projects
- [Employee Turnover Analysis](https://github.com/claudiecoulombe/analytics_portfolio/tree/main/Employee%20Turnover): Analyzing turnover trends and recommendations for retention.
- Predictive Performance Modeling: Using assessment scores (e.g., cognitive ability, personality traits, technical skills) to predict job performance or productivity. This is an example of a local validation study.
- Competency-Based Team Optimization Project: By creating groups that are either highly cohesive (minimizing competency differences within teams) or highly diverse (maximizing competency differences within teams), this analysis aims to support strategic team-building for varied project needs, such as projects requiring rapid consensus or innovation-driven initiatives.
- Remote Work Productivity Analysis: Explore differences in productivity, engagement, and turnover rates among remote, hybrid, and on-site employees. Assess which work modes yield the highest levels of productivity and employee satisfaction, as well as how remote work policies impact turnover or engagement.
