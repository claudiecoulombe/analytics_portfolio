# Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my analytics portfolio! This is a collection of projects Iâ€™ve created to highlight my approach to solving business challenges in people analytics, data science, and data analysis.

## Projects

### (1) Predicting and Understanding Employee Turnover
In this project, I analyzed employee turnover at Fictional Solutions Inc. to uncover key drivers and identify employees at risk of leaving, offering insights to guide future retention programs and strategies.

**Key Deliverables**:
- **[Dashboard](https://5yurvz-claudiecoulombe.shinyapps.io/employee_turnover/)**: An interactive tool designed for key stakeholders to visualize turnover trends and explore relationships between turnover and variables such as satisfaction, workload, salary, and performance levels. More suitable for stakeholders, it provides an interactive overview of the analysis, including a summary of key findings on the main page.
- **Quarto Report**: A detailed Markdown report summarizing the analysis, key analytical decisions, findings, and recommendations. More suitable for internal data professionals at Fictional Logistics Inc., it can be used for transparency and replicability purposes.

### (2) Validating a Selection Approach
In this project, I validated a selection methodology that incorporated multiple assessment scores. The analysis focused on evaluating whether the combined scores predicted performance more effectively than each score individually.
